# Mess-Manager
Mess Manager is a full-stack project that simplifies the complete management of mess, both from mess admins and the user side. This project's main objective is to reduce food waste by pre-booking meals and confirming each member's presence in the mess. 
The application supports two kinds of users- Admin (Mess owners) and Members (people added in a mess). From an owner's perspective, the mess manager digitalizes their management system with a very simple and easy-to-use interface.
